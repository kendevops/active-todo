## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Javascript
- Local storage



### What I learned

Working on this project made me know how to use word break in css and also, it helped reinforce other things i knew before.  



### Continued development

I need to work more on my javascript and some aspects of my css styling.


### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://youtu.be/Z43SXaDPo2s) - This video really helped me build the project using a different style/method. I also learnt more on how to use local storage from the video
